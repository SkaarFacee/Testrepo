## Hotel Management System 

Hi! I'm Sanjay Raju. My git id is @sanjjayrj. 
So I developed this programme to function as a hotel management system. This programme can be used by any luxurious hotel to keep track of multiple residents. Can also serve as a ordeing interface for dining situation.

# Files
This programme contains a file which contains the details of each residents stored in a single line of the document. Users can browse the details of residents via the unique ID number provided by the system or their other details to know about their status.

## Delete a file
When checking out the customers file get the status of "checked-out" and won't be displayed in the directory anymore.
